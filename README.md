To run this program make sure that you have the following libraries installed on your machine hosting Python 3:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. TKinter
4. MatPlotLib
5. Dill
6. Pickle

To run this program:

1. Save our files into a folder and open in VS Code
2. The project directory structure should be the same as seen in our GitHub
3. If all the .pkl files are in the /algorithms folder, run the GUI.py script to fully use all the implementations
4. If not, execute each algorithm python file and wait for the .pkl file to be save in the /algorithms folder
5. Now, execute the GUI.py python script

The algorithms to make each model are found in the /algorithms folder. The models for each algorithm are saved as .pkl files and are seen in the /algorihms folder of the project. To save a new model for each algorithm, simple execute the algorithm python file.

The dataset folder hosts the accessed dataset. 'meteorites.csv' is an exact replica of 'Meteorite_Landings_20240909.csv'. The later is the default name.

App_Icon.ico is the image associated with the GUI.

GUI.py is the main file that incorperates everything in the project.
